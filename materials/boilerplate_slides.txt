# Welcome to Python Programming!

::: {.callout-tip}
**Let's make learning Python fun, colourful, and practical!**

## What are literals?

Literals are fixed values in your code. They can be numbers, strings, booleans, etc.

::: {.callout-note}
**Examples:**
- `42` (integer)
- `3.14` (float)
- `'hello'` (string)
- `True`, `False` (boolean)
:::

## Python Code Sample

```python
age = 18
pi = 3.14159
greeting = "Hello, world!"
is_active = True
```

## Interesting Application

Use literals to set default values in games, apps, or data analysis scripts!

# Review Python Variables and Operators

## What are variables?

Variables store data you want to use or change.

## Operators

Operators let you do math, compare values, and more!

::: {.callout-important}
**Examples:**
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power)
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`
:::

## Python Code Sample

```python
x = 5
y = 2
sum = x + y
product = x * y
is_equal = (x == y)
x += 1
```

## Interesting Application

Variables and operators are the backbone of calculators, games, and simulations!

# Review Python Loops and Conditionals

## Loops

Loops repeat actions. Use `for` and `while` loops.

## Conditionals

Conditionals let your code make decisions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Examples:**
```python
for i in range(5):
	print(i)

count = 0
while count < 3:
	print("Counting:", count)
	count += 1

if x > y:
	print("x is greater!")
elif x == y:
	print("x equals y!")
else:
	print("x is less!")
```
:::

## Interesting Application

Loops and conditionals power everything from sorting algorithms to interactive stories!
