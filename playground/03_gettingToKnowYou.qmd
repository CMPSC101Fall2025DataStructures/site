## Introduce Your Partner!

Choose the person sitting right next to you. Have a conversation with the person to find out who they are. Ask them about;

+ How they would like to be called in class,
+ Where they are from, 
+ What types of classes they like,
+ What they enjoy doing on campus,
+ What is their favorite music
+ Why they are in this course at Allegheny College. Take turns sharing.


Then, each of you will present the other to the course today.
