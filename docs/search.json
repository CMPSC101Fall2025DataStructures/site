    "text": "Course Description\nA continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their ability to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.\nQuantitative Reasoning (QR): Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.\nScientific Process and Knowledge (SP): Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.\n\nPrerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.\nDistribution Requirements: QR, SP."

These assignments will invite students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization. Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for instance, its efficiency and correctness. Knowledge gained from the class and the textbook will be integral to the completion of these projects. Unless other information is given about a due date, activities are to be completed by the end of class.\nExams: The exams will cover all of the material in their associated module(s). The finalized date for each of the exams will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take these exams on the scheduled date and complete the exams in the stated period of time.\nFinal Project: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated programming solution for a specific problem. Completion of the final project will require you to apply the knowledge, programming and technical skills that you have acquired during the course.

    "text": "Additional Policies\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to come to class prepared, on time, and to stay engaged for the duration of the class period. This includes both class and lab sessions. This behavior is core to our shared departmental values and is in addition to the college’s attendance policy.\nEach day of class, please complete the attendance form.\n\nPreparedness\nComing to class prepared means coming with everything you need to engage in a class session. To satisfy basic expectations of CIS courses, this means, at minimum, that students must:\n\narrive at class with a fully charged laptop\nbring their laptop charger or a battery pack so as to ensure that their laptop works throughout the entire class session\ncomplete any pre-session work such as readings and preparatory assignments\n\n\n\nAttendance and Lateness\nOne missed class or lab session counts as one absence. Coming to class/lab late, leaving early, or missing a large portion of a class/lab session will result in your being marked as “late” to class. Coming to class/lab unprepared may also result in being marked “late”. Being marked “late” to class three times during the course of a semester is equal to one absence.\nExcluding the first week of the semester, students can have eight absences without any impact to their grade. These accommodations are meant to cover illness and emergency, so you should always come to class if you are able to do so.\nAs a general guideline, students cannot miss more than two weeks of class in total throughout the academic semester without receiving a letter grade reduction.\nFor this course, excluding the first week and eight excused absences, overall course grade will go down by 1/3 of a letter grade for each additional absence or absence equivalence regardless of base grade.\n\n\nEngagement\nThe term “engagement” or our expectation that students remain “engaged” can mean many things, often varying by course. Baseline behaviors that indicate engagement include:\n\nparticipation in class activities and discussions\ndefined contribution to class sessions in full-class or group discussions\nnote-taking (physical or digital)\nparticipating in course session attendance requirements\nnot participating in non-course related activities\nnot completing non-course related projects\n\n\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nThe deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines. This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively.\nAll students in the CIS department are expected to turn in assignments on time. “On time” means on or before the assignment’s due date. This means that an assignment cannot be turned in for credit after a due date, unless the student applies a token.\n\nTokens\nStudents in 101 are allotted four tokens to receive extensions on any assignment except the final with no questions asked by the course instructor except either in the rare cases of documented severe and/or extenuating circumstances or in cases that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.\n\nA token may be applied via a Google Form up to the assignment deadline, with exceptions granted only for severe and/or extenuating circumstances.\nTokens grant an automatic extension of one week to anything except the project or final exam.\nTokens will not be accepted after the due date of the last lab. This means that token usage will end after the labs are complete and will no longer be accepted. This roughly implies that they will stop three or four weeks from the end of class.\n\nToken Form for Automatic Extension\n\n\n\nExtenuating Circumstances\nExtenuating circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, outside of your control, and short-term, like illness and emergency. Regular circumstances associated with taking courses at Allegheny College are not considered extenuating.\nThe accommodations provided by tokens and permitted absences are meant to cover extenuating circumstances like illness, emergency, and work. However, if you have a contagious illness like COVID-19, the flu, or a cold, you should not come to class. If you have expended all your absences and tokens and are still sick with a contagious illness, you may contact your professor about options. If your symptoms are mild or you are recovering from a respiratory illness, we recommend that you wear a mask to class.\nProfessor must be informed of all athletic obligations at the beginning of the semester, or with as much notice as possible. If you are feeling healthy and well, you should make every effort to come to class on time and to complete assignments, rather than using absences and tokens you may need later.\nThese no-questions-asked accommodations are meant to protect student privacy, and to remove the additional effort of acquiring documentation under duress of illness or emergency. In addition, they allow the professor to remain focused on teaching rather than adjudicating excuses.\nIf extenuating circumstances are severe enough to require more absences and tokens, you may contact your professor to discuss options. In most cases, however, a situation of this gravity warrants a request for a “Late Drop” or “Incomplete” in the course, as the student will not have had adequate opportunity to learn the material."

Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following Honor Code pledge:\n\nI hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.\n\n\nEffective Collaboration\nComputer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. The Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not acceptable.\n\nAcceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nDiscussing high-level concepts.\nReferring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs, or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.\nOutlining the high-level steps to solving a problem, without mentioning specific\nlines of code that need to be written.\n\nUnacceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nSharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your source code to someone or looking at someone else’s code.\nCopying someone else’s source code, technical writing, program commands, or program output, even with some slight modifications.\nTyping source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s computer.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism and Artificial Intelligence\nStudents may not pass off or represent the work of another student, or their own prior work, as their own current work in any case. Plagiarism and AI-generated code, text, or images are not permitted in any assignment type unless the instructions supplied for the assignment explicitly state otherwise.For exams and all other coursework, students are expected to adhere to the given instructions for the particular exam or item of coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to review the authorization specifications on every item and act appropriately, upholding the honor code. Suspected plagiarized or unauthorized use of AI to generate the work that is turned in will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. This policy does not preclude the use of AI to learn."

It’s much more efficient than recursion, using O(n) time and O(1) space.\n\nExample Code:\ndef fibonacci_iterative(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate Fibonacci number using iteration\"\"\"\n    if n &lt;= 1:\n        return n\n    \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n\n# Test with larger numbers (try 50, 100)\nfor i in [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]:\n    print(f'F({i}) = {fibonacci_iterative(i)}')\n\n# Show the sequence\nprint(\"\\nFirst 20 Fibonacci numbers:\")\nfib_sequence = [fibonacci_iterative(i) for i in range(20)]\nprint(fib_sequence)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Python interpreter…\n\n\n\n\n\ndef fibonacci_iterative(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate Fibonacci number using iteration\"\"\"\n    if n &lt;= 1:\n        return n\n    \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n\n# Test with larger numbers (try 50, 100)\nfor i in [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]:\n    print(f'F({i}) = {fibonacci_iterative(i)}')\n\n# Show the sequence\nprint(\"\\nFirst 20 Fibonacci numbers:\")\nfib_sequence = [fibonacci_iterative(i) for i in range(20)]\nprint(fib_sequence)\n\n▶ Run Code 🗑 Clear\n\n\nExample 3: Binet’s Formula\n\nWhat this code does: This uses Binet’s closed-form formula to calculate Fibonacci numbers directly using the golden ratio. It’s mathematically elegant and theoretically O(1), but limited by floating-point precision for very large numbers.\n\nExample Code:\nimport math\n\ndef fibonacci_binet(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate Fibonacci number using Binet's formula\"\"\"\n    if n &lt;= 1:\n        return n\n    \n    # Golden ratio\n    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n    psi = (1 - math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n    \n    # Binet's formula\n    result = (phi**n - psi**n) / math.sqrt(5)\n    return round(result)\n\n# Test Binet's formula\nprint(\"Binet's Formula Results:\")\nfor i in range(15):\n    print(f'F({i}) = {fibonacci_binet(i)}')\n\n# Compare accuracy with iterative method\nprint(\"\\nAccuracy comparison (Binet vs Iterative):\")\nfor i in [20, 30, 40, 50]:\n    binet_result = fibonacci_binet(i)\n    iterative_result = fibonacci_iterative(i)\n    match = \"✓\" if binet_result == iterative_result else \"✗\"\n    print(f'F({i}): Binet={binet_result}, Iterative={iterative_result} {match}')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Python interpreter…\n\n\n\n\n\nimport math\n\ndef fibonacci_binet(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate Fibonacci number using Binet's formula\"\"\"\n    if n &lt;= 1:\n        return n\n    \n    # Golden ratio\n    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n    psi = (1 - math.sqrt(5)) / 2\n    \n    # Binet's formula\n    result = (phi**n - psi**n) / math.sqrt(5)\n    return round(result)\n\n# Test Binet's formula\nprint(\"Binet's Formula Results:\")\nfor i in range(15):\n    print(f'F({i}) = {fibonacci_binet(i)}')\n\n# Compare accuracy with iterative method\nprint(\"\\nAccuracy comparison (Binet vs Iterative):\")\nfor i in [20, 30, 40, 50]:\n    binet_result = fibonacci_binet(i)\n    iterative_result = fibonacci_iterative(i)\n    match = \"✓\" if binet_result == iterative_result else \"✗\"\n    print(f'F({i}): Binet={binet_result}, Iterative={iterative_result} {match}')\n\n▶ Run Code 🗑 Clear\n\n\nChallenge Yourself\n\nPerformance Comparison Challenge\nNow that you’ve seen all three methods, let’s compare their performance!

It behaves like a regular function but is contained within the class’s namespace for logical organization.\nThe @classmethod decorator is a built-in decorator used to define a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class.\nThe @property decorator is a built-in decorator used to define managed attributes within a class. It allows you to transform regular methods into “properties,” which can be accessed like attributes but have underlying getter, setter, and deleter methods to control their behavior."

They allow you to organize and manage collections of data efficiently:\n\nLists are ordered collections that can store multiple items in sequence\nDictionaries are collections of key-value pairs that allow you to quickly look up values using unique keys\n\nThink of a list like a shopping list where the order matters, and a dictionary like a phone book where you look up a person’s name (key) to find their phone number (value)."

    "section": "Key Concepts",
    "text": "Key Concepts\n\n\n💡 Concept 1: Lists - Ordered Collections\n\nLists are ordered, mutable collections that can store multiple items. Items in a list are accessed by their position (index), starting from 0.\nExample:\n# Creating a list with three string elements\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n# Access the first element (index 0) and print it\nprint(fruits[0])  # Outputs: apple\n\n\n\n💡 Concept 2: Dictionaries - Key-Value Pairs\n\nDictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Instead of using numeric indices, you use meaningful keys to access values quickly.\nExample:\n# Creating a dictionary with string keys and mixed value types\nstudent = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"}\n# Access the value associated with the \"name\" key\nprint(student[\"name\"])  # Outputs: Alice"

Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters. To use a function, you “call” it by its name and provide the required arguments.\nExample:\ndef squareArea(s: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine area of square\"\"\"\n    return s * s\n\n\n\n💡 Concept 2: Flow of Execution\n\nPython executes code from top to bottom. The main() function is often used as a “driver” to organize the flow. When main() is called, it runs the code inside it, including any function calls.\nExample:\ndef main() -&gt; None:\n    sideLength = 5\n    print(f\"Length {sideLength}\")\n    print(f\" Area: {squareArea(sideLength)}\")\n\n\nExample 1a: Calculating the Area of a Rectangle\n\nWhat this code does: Defines a function to calculate the area of a rectangle and calls it with sample values.\n\nExample Code:\ndef rectangleArea(length: float, width: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine area of rectangle\"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\nprint(rectangleArea(6, 3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Python interpreter…\n\n\n\n\n\ndef rectangleArea(length: float, width: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine area of rectangle\"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\nprint(rectangleArea(6, 3))\n\n\n▶ Run Code 🗑 Clear 🔍+ Larger Font 🔍- Smaller Font\n\n\nExample 1b: Calculating the Area of a Circle\n\nWhat this code does: Defines a function to calculate the area of a circle and calls it with a sample value.\n\nExample Code:\nimport math\ndef circleArea(radius: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine area of circle\"\"\"\n    return math.pi * radius * radius\n\nprint(circleArea(2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Python interpreter…\n\n\n\n\n\nimport math\ndef circleArea(radius: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine area of circle\"\"\"\n    return math.pi * radius * radius\n\nprint(circleArea(2))\n\n\n▶ Run Code 🗑 Clear 🔍+ Larger Font 🔍- Smaller Font\n\n\nExample 1c: Calculating the Volume of a Cube\n\nWhat this code does: Defines a function to calculate the volume of a cube and calls it with a sample value.\n\nExample Code:\ndef cubeVolume(s: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine volume of cube\"\"\"\n    return s ** 3\n\nprint(cubeVolume(3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Python interpreter…\n\n\n\n\n\ndef cubeVolume(s: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\" determine volume of cube\"\"\"\n    return s ** 3\n\nprint(cubeVolume(3))\n\n\n▶ Run Code 🗑 Clear 🔍+ Larger Font 🔍- Smaller Font\n\n\nChallenge Questions\n\nChoose a function to check whether a side can have a negative distance value.

These assignments will invite students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization. Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for instance, its efficiency and correctness. Knowledge gained from the class and the textbook will be integral to the completion of these projects. Unless other information is given about a due date, activities are to be completed by the end of class.\nExams: The exams will cover all of the material in their associated module(s). The finalized date for each of the exams will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take these exams on the scheduled date and complete the exams in the stated period of time.\nFinal Project: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated programming solution for a specific problem. Completion of the final project will require you to apply the knowledge, programming and technical skills that you have acquired during the course. The details for the final project will be given approximately a month before the project due date (during finals week)."

    "text": "Additional Policies\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to come to class prepared, on time, and to stay engaged for the duration of the class period. This includes both class and lab sessions. This behavior is core to our shared departmental values and is in addition to the college’s attendance policy.\nEach day of class, please complete the attendance form.\n\nPreparedness\nComing to class prepared means coming with everything you need to engage in a class session. To satisfy basic expectations of CIS courses, this means, at minimum, that students must:\n\narrive at class with a fully charged laptop\nbring their laptop charger or a battery pack so as to ensure that their laptop works throughout the entire class session\ncomplete any pre-session work such as readings and preparatory assignments\n\n\n\nAttendance and Lateness\nOne missed class or lab session counts as one absence. Coming to class/lab late, leaving early, or missing a large portion of a class/lab session will result in your being marked as “late” to class. Coming to class/lab unprepared may also result in being marked “late”. Being marked “late” to class three times during the course of a semester is equal to one absence.\nExcluding the first week of the semester, students can have eight absences without any impact to their grade. These accommodations are meant to cover illness and emergency, so you should always come to class if you are able to do so.\nAs a general guideline, students cannot miss more than two weeks of class in total throughout the academic semester without receiving a letter grade reduction.\nFor this course, excluding the first week and eight excused absences, overall course grade will go down by 1/3 of a letter grade for each additional absence or absence equivalence regardless of base grade.\n\n\nEngagement\nThe term “engagement” or our expectation that students remain “engaged” can mean many things, often varying by course. Baseline behaviors that indicate engagement include:\n\nparticipation in class activities and discussions\ndefined contribution to class sessions in full-class or group discussions\nnote-taking (physical or digital)\nparticipating in course session attendance requirements\nnot participating in non-course related activities\nnot completing non-course related projects\n\n\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nThe deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines. This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively.\nAll students in the CIS department are expected to turn in assignments on time. “On time” means on or before the assignment’s due date. This means that an assignment cannot be turned in for credit after a due date, unless the student applies a token.\n\nTokens\nStudents in 101 are allotted four tokens to receive extensions on any assignment except the final with no questions asked by the course instructor except either in the rare cases of documented severe and/or extenuating circumstances or in cases that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.\n\nA token may be applied via a Google Form up to the assignment deadline, with exceptions granted only for severe and/or extenuating circumstances.\nTokens grant an automatic extension of one week to anything except the project or final exam.\nTokens will not be accepted after the due date of the last lab. This means that token usage will end after the labs are complete and will no longer be accepted. This roughly implies that they will stop three or four weeks from the end of class.\n\nToken Form for Automatic Extension\n\n\n\nExtenuating Circumstances\nExtenuating circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, outside of your control, and short-term, like illness and emergency. Regular circumstances associated with taking courses at Allegheny College are not considered extenuating.\nThe accommodations provided by tokens and permitted absences are meant to cover extenuating circumstances like illness, emergency, and work. However, if you have a contagious illness like COVID-19, the flu, or a cold, you should not come to class. If you have expended all your absences and tokens and are still sick with a contagious illness, you may contact your professor about options. If your symptoms are mild or you are recovering from a respiratory illness, we recommend that you wear a mask to class.\nProfessor must be informed of all athletic obligations at the beginning of the semester, or with as much notice as possible. If you are feeling healthy and well, you should make every effort to come to class on time and to complete assignments, rather than using absences and tokens you may need later.\nThese no-questions-asked accommodations are meant to protect student privacy, and to remove the additional effort of acquiring documentation under duress of illness or emergency. In addition, they allow the professor to remain focused on teaching rather than adjudicating excuses.\nIf extenuating circumstances are severe enough to require more absences and tokens, you may contact your professor to discuss options. In most cases, however, a situation of this gravity warrants a request for a “Late Drop” or “Incomplete” in the course, as the student will not have had adequate opportunity to learn the material."

The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following Honor Code pledge:\n\nI hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.\n\n\nEffective Collaboration\nComputer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. The Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not acceptable.\n\nAcceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nDiscussing high-level concepts.\nReferring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs, or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.\nOutlining the high-level steps to solving a problem, without mentioning specific\nlines of code that need to be written.\n\nUnacceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nSharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your source code to someone or looking at someone else’s code.\nCopying someone else’s source code, technical writing, program commands, or program output, even with some slight modifications.\nTyping source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s computer.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism and Artificial Intelligence\nStudents may not pass off or represent the work of another student, or their own prior work, as their own current work in any case. Plagiarism and AI-generated code, text, or images are not permitted in any assignment type unless the instructions supplied for the assignment explicitly state otherwise.For exams and all other coursework, students are expected to adhere to the given instructions for the particular exam or item of coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to review the authorization specifications on every item and act appropriately, upholding the honor code. Suspected plagiarized or unauthorized use of AI to generate the work that is turned in will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. This policy does not preclude the use of AI to learn."
